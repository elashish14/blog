My name is Ashish Banerjee, and this is my personal website.

I am a software engineer. I can write code in most major languages, but prefer
Python most of all. Most of the code I write is for web development or research
(primarily data science) purposes. I love Linux and have used several
distributions. I started out using Ubuntu, Debian and Mint. Lately however, I
have been using Gentoo, Alpine and Void.

My other interests and hobbies include craft beer, taekwondo, and professional
Dota 2.

I hope to write more here in the future to share some of my musings.
