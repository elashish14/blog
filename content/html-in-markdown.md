My favourite feature of Markdown is... not using markdown at all! Since
markdown is a superset of HTML, it is possible to simply include plain HTML
code in markdown documents like so

    :::html
    <a href="/">Go to home</a>

Which will render as this:

<a href="/">Go to home</a>

I use this feature most for inserting images, because (1) I can never remember
the syntax to do it in markdown and (2) it makes it easier to add additional
styling around said images (like the width or height). It's actually quite nice
that markdown is so simple - it's focus is on providing some simple styling and
nothing more. For everything else, there's HTML.
