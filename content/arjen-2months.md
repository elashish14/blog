Arjen Banerjee is about 2 months old now. Here are a few more photos:

He is definitely growing both physically and mentally. He is showing many more
facial expressions and starting to laugh and smile more. It is irresistibly
cute. In fact, [here is a video of him giving multiple smiles at
once]({static}/images/arjen2/arjen5.mp4), which isn't uncommon when he's in a
good mood. It's also increasingly common to hear him gurgle and baby talk as
well, or for him to watch you as you move around the room.

Ultimately, I have to say that watching a child develop is a remarkable
experience. We continue to look forward to his next developments.
