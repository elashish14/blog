Here is an example of code samples in a Pelican post:

    :::python
    print("Hello world!")

And here is how one writes it in a post:

    :::markdown
    :::python
    print("Hello world!")

And I created the last block like so:

    :::markdown
    :::markdown
    :::python
    print("Hello world!")

I will not include another block explaining how I created the last block.
