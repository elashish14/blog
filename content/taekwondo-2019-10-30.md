I had an interesting week of practice last week. I sparred a couple of
competitors during practice last week on 2019-10-22 who are much taller than I
am, and I had to rely on my closing/clinching game. Overall, I was quite
successful in setting up my attacks, but it is still a long way for me to be
competitive against these kinds of fighters. Below are the things that I
learned from these sparring experiences:

* My closing approach seems to be working very well so far. Even some very fast
  front leg-fighters were not able to prevent this attack/setup.

* Fakes, sidesteps, and checks are all extremely important in a good close.
  Their main benefit is that they enable the shorter fighter to dictate the
  timing and set up opportunities to close safely. They have also proved to be
  very important in setting up headshots.

* Once in the clinch, keep pushing and kicking rather than immediately
  switching to defense. Or in other words, I am not making the most of my time
  in this range. I can push more, kick more, and attack more in general before
  closing in the range and playing defense.

* However, when trying to follow the previous piece of advice, I was spending
  *too long* pushing and setting up attacks. So it is also important to not get
  carried away in setting up because I fell into the trap of getting countered
  while doing this.

* It was also recommended to just do single kicks in close range, rather than
  doubles. I don't fully understand why this is, but I'll keep experimenting
  with both and see how they work.

* Finally, I must keep my head up the clinch. At times, I would lean forward
  while in the clinch and my opponent had an easy time hitting a headshot from
  behind. If I keep my head up, then I will have a better chance of seeing the
  attack coming and blocking it. Maintaining balance (ie. not falling forward
  while moving in) is an important part of managing this.

It was rewarding to see that the strategies that I'm using are still
successful, even against the other fighters that we train with (and who are far
more skilled than I am). Over the past couple of years, I have been realising
that I am trying to develop a style of sparring that prioritises shut-down
defense and only attacking when the opportunity is sound, and it still appears
to be working well. These lessons learned will help me improve and refine that
strategy.
