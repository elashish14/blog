This week featured some fun and interesting drills. In particular, we did a
kicking combination on Thursday that I enjoyed a lot and want to remember for
future reference. Here it is:

> Start in a natural stance with the left foot front.
>
> 1. Front-leg double cut,
> 2. Back leg turning kick, landing forward (now the right foot is in front),
> 3. Shuffle backward,
> 4. Back-front Double-kick (right foot remains in front),
> 5. Pancake kick landing forward in a what is basically a reverse natural
>    stance,
> 6. Spinning heel kick, coming all the way around (between the previous step
>    and this one, stance changes back to left foot in front),
> 7. 540 spinning heel kick, using the continuing momentum from previous kick.
>    Or alternately, narabaum into heel kick without putting the kicking foot
>    down after the narabaum.

For myself, it is more natural to start this drill with the right foot front
instead, so the 540 is done with the right foot in front. The pancake kick
into spinning heel kick is particularly satisfying because the reverse natural
stance makes it extremely easy to throw the follow-up kick. Portions of this
drill are actually surprisingly practical in competition sparring; if I'm in a
clowny mood one of these days, I might actually try the sequence in a sparring
match.

I introduced a portion of this drill on Sunday, specifically steps 5 and 6. It
worked out nicely, seeing as we had already started pancake kick the week
before, and this was quite a natural drill to continue building on it. (Then
again, quite a lot of the attendees this week were not present the week
before. Oh well.) I was quite impressed by how many people were willing to
try the pancake kick into the spinning heel kick. On the other hand, a lot of
people were also struggling to understand the pancake kick, and I have to
admit that I have a hard time relating it to people who are trying to learn
it.

Nevertheless, I feel that pancake kick is extremely useful in sparring as
it is difficult to block and a fairly reliable kick to score with. It is also
a very useful kick to know if you want to teach people how to block during a
sparring match. So I want to continue woring on this kick and hope people will
continue to learn how to throw it better.

We also focused a bit on getting a nice, tight cut kick. A lot of people tend
to be a bit lazy with the cut kick so that the kick rises as it travels
forward. While that is faster, it is also a bit more unreliable. So we focused
bringing the knee close to the body and extending outward. Or in other words,
bringing the kicking foot up first, and extending forward second. This makes
the kick much harder to block and also results in a straighter, direct and
more impactful kick.

For cardio, we did a set of running man drills: 30, 40 and then 50. It was
slightly excessive and should probably be reworked to make it more diverse. We
also did three sets of push-ups and sit-ups.

Next week, I feel like it might be a good idea to focus more on some turning
kick fundamentals. I would like to make sure that our kicks travel
horizontally and not upwards. I also want to emphasize that we need to return
to a natural stance after every kick as this continues to be difficult for
quite a lot of students.
